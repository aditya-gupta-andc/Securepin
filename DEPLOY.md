# Deployment Guide

## GitHub Repository Setup

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Choose a repository name
   - Make it public or private as needed
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. Initialize local repository and push to GitHub:
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Environment Setup

1. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in your production environment
   - Add the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   ```

2. Database setup:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database
   - Update the DATABASE_URL in your environment
   - Run migrations: `npm run db:push`

## Build and Deploy

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Traditional Hosting
- Deploy to any Node.js hosting service (Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc.)
- Set up environment variables in your hosting platform
- Follow the hosting provider's deployment instructions

### Option 2: GitHub Pages (Frontend Only)
Note: This option only works for static content. You'll need a separate backend hosting solution.

1. In your repository settings, enable GitHub Pages
2. Select the branch to deploy (usually `gh-pages` or `main`)
3. Configure the build settings if needed

### Option 3: Vercel/Netlify
These platforms offer easy deployment from GitHub:
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist/public`
3. Set up environment variables in the platform settings

## Post-Deployment

1. Test the application thoroughly
2. Monitor for any errors
3. Set up logging if needed
4. Configure any necessary security measures

Remember to never commit sensitive information like API keys or database credentials to the repository.
